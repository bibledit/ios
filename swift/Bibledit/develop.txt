Creating the basic app structure
================================

* Creat a new iOS app, choose SwiftUI and language Swift.
* Add a new C++ file to the Bibledit folder, including the header file.
* Xcode will ask whether to create a bridging header: Do so.
* Set C++ and Objective-C Interoperability to "C++/Objective-C++".
* Surround the C++ API with "extern "C" {}".
