Creating the basic app structure
================================

* Creat a new iOS app, choose SwiftUI and language Swift.
* Add a new C++ file to the Bibledit folder, including the header file.
* Xcode will ask whether to create a bridging header: Do so.
* Set C++ and Objective-C Interoperability to "C++/Objective-C++".
* Surround the C++ API with "extern "C" {}".

Hints for compiling C and C++ code
==================================

* Set the (user) header search paths to: ${PROJECT_DIR}/Bibledit/src
* Set the excluded source file names to: ${PROJECT_DIR}/Bibledit/src/utf8proc/utf8proc_data.c
* The Bibledit kernel source is not in git: Get it through the ./refresh.sh script.
